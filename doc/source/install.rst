How to install it
=================

**Requirement:**

The **ALRosBridge** is made to be compiled with qiBuild so you first need to install it: ::

  $ pip install qibuild

To set up your environment and start using qiBuild, run the following commands: ::

  $ mkdir ~/qibuild_ws
  $ cd ~/qibuild_ws
  $ qibuild init

If you encounter any issue, please refer to `qiBuild documentation <http://doc.aldebaran.com/qibuild/>`_.

When qiBuild compiles, it will only look for dependencies within a toolchain, so one needs to be created: ::

  # Create the toolchain
  $ qitoolchain create <tc_name>
  $ qibuild add-config <tc_name> -t <tc_name>

  # Add a package that will find your local ROS installation
  $ cd ~/qibuild_ws
  $ git clone https://github.com/ros-naoqi/ros-toolchain.git
  $ ./ros-toolchain/update_toolchain.sh local_ros <tc_name>

Download the dependencies of the alrosbridge ::

  $ cd ~/qibuild_ws
  $ qisrc add https://github.com/aldebaran/gtest.git
  $ qisrc add https://github.com/aldebaran/libqiprobes.git
  $ qisrc add https://github.com/aldebaran/libqicore.git
  $ qisrc add https://github.com/aldebaran/libqi.git

Download this project and compile it ::

  $ cd ~/qibuild_ws
  $ qisrc add https://github.com/ros-naoqi/alrosbridge.git
  $ cd alrosbridge
  $ qibuild configure -c <tc_name>
  $ qibuild make -c <tc_name>

Once compilation is over, the resulting binary will be in *~/qibuild_ws/alrosbridge/build-<tcname>/sdk/bin/alrosbridge_bin*

If you encounter any compilation issue, (unable to find some dependencies), you might need to install them (through *apt-get install* for instance)

Once you successfully compiled the module, you can learn how to use it on the :ref:`Getting started page <start>` or you can go back to the :ref:`index <main menu>`.
